# Air Quality Assessment Tool

Create a simple Air Quality Assessment Tool using the front end technologies of your choice that utilizes Open AQ (https://docs.openaq.org/docs) Platform API. It will have the ability to compare the Air Quality of two cities.

The tool must:

Allow the user to input two cities
Display the air quality of the corresponding cities, allowing the user to compare the two
Gracefully handle any API or user errors
Tool should be easily used by the general public
